<p>After a thrilling few weeks of March Madness, we&rsquo;re down to the fourth-seeded UConn Huskies and the fifth-seeded San Diego State Aztecs in the NCAA championship game. San Diego State has already smashed its program record this year, having never made it past the Sweet 16, and UConn is looking to secure its fifth championship. It&rsquo;ll be an upset if the Aztecs can take home the trophy, but, as we&rsquo;ve been reminded all tournament long, upsets are always possible during March Madness.</p>

<p>The two teams have only played each other once before, all the way back in the Sweet 16 of the 2011 March Madness tournament.</p>

<p>In this year&rsquo;s tournament, the Huskies have dominated every opponent they&rsquo;ve met. Their most recent game against Miami was their narrowest win at 72-59. Before that game, UConn won every game by at least 15 points. And this kind of performance is not unusual for Connecticut. This is the program&rsquo;s sixth championship opportunity, and they already have four titles (secured in 1999, 2004, 2011, and 2014).</p>

<p>But the Aztecs have been on-point all tournament as well, capped off by a Final Four victory straight out of a movie: â€‹With 0.7 seconds on the clock, junior guard Lamont Butler hit a pull-up jump shot to give San Diego a 72-71 win over Florida Atlantic. Plus, San Diego has a defensive edge over the Huskies and a slightly better season record of 32-6 compared to UConn&rsquo;s 30-8.</p>

<p>And the Aztecs will have to pull off another miracle tonight to secure its first championship. Prior to this year&rsquo;s tournament, San Diego had never passed the Sweet 16, which they reached in 2011 and 2014.</p>
